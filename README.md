- audio: alex343xd
- russian translation: [matt7ress](https://twitter.com/mattr7ess)
- everything else: yours truly

note: this is currently going through the transition to godot 4 (specifically godot 4.2.0) so everything is broken, check [the 0.10 branch](https://github.com/hellory4n/lelcubeos/tree/0.10) to see code that works

this also uses .net 8
